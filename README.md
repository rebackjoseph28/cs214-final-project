# CS214 Final Project
This code is based on the final perceptron evaluation created in PA9 for CS214.

## The Goal
Create a working system to view perceptron clusters as depth images themselves, to visualize classes easier and test code easier.
Additionally, based on how many classes there are, attempt to classify images based on class names and confidence.

## Running the Code
The program takes three arguments: training images list, test images list, and how many clusters to group by
